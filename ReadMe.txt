To run the code, follow the instructions:

1. Input the desired start node in the ENPM661_Project1.py using column-wise format.

i.e.
StartNode =  [1, 4, 7, 2, 5, 8, 3, 6, 0] 

Corresponds to the eight puzzle state:
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 0

2. Run the program. The terminal will print whether the puzzle was solved or not

3. If the puzzle was solved, run plot_path.py to visualize the path between your 
start node and the goal node
